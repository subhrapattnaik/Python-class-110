
Recap :
-------
We have learned that normal distributions can be seen as probability
distributions.

Mean = Median = Mode in a normal distribution and corresponds to 
the peak value

Normal distribution is symmetric around the peak value.

68% of all data lie within one standard deviation of the mean
95% of all the data lie within two standard deviation of the mean
99% of all the data lie within three standard deviation of the mean
-------------------------------------------------------------

We have discovered that most of the
data in the natural world follows a
normal distribution. But there are
some data sets which do not follow a
normal distribution. We're going to
explore and analyze this kind of data
in today's class.

Data sampling is a statistical analysis technique used to select,
 manipulate and analyze a representative subset of data points to 
 identify patterns and trends in the larger data set being examined.
